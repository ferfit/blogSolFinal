        I was born in Argentinian Patagonia, in one of the most southern cities in the world.
        Since I was a little girl, I’ve been a Searcher; a lawyer and a criminality major
        (graduated in my country), I’ve spent my last undergraduate years travelling around
        South America alone, as a backpacker. Surfing spontaneity, disbanding my routine and
        the foundations that I made myself “believe” in, to adapt to a system I consider
        “obsolete”. 
        <br>
        My awakening began on a trip with friends to Brazil, where I spent New Year’s Eve in
        Rio de Janeiro, in “Reveillon”, a party and personal ritual where I cried, forgave myself
        and promised to go look for my real Happiness.
        I came back to Buenos Aires and a month later, I packed and boxed my whole life and
        just allowed myself to take with me what would fit in a backpack. My destiny: The
        world.
        <br>
        ¡How naïve I was! After I landed in Barcelona, Spain, I crossed over to Ibiza and it was
        in this Magical Island where I started experiencing every minute, at each step and with
        every feeling, the synchronicity of my final destination being my Magical Island. As
        simple as that. My first year went by as a complete vacation. Time of deserving, joy
        and enjoyment to break up my programming, my structures and my beliefs. Time to
        rebuild myself in Self Love. And that was how letting and letting and letting go, I finally
        made room for my real Being, and nurtured the essence of my Heart.  
        <br>
        In this hard process that has taken me 10 years already, I’ve fallen in love with life,
        with myself, and with my wonderful Italian husband with whom we travel to different
        continents every year. We strategically choose different countries to keep our passion
        alive and carry on with our studies, but now also exploring the holistic world, getting
        started with different therapies, workshops and retreats, sharing Wisdom with
        ancestral communities, soaking everything and everyone in, to be able to be here now,
        rooted in my goal to support and walk along many other Searchers towards their
        encounter with their own Beings.
        I open up to life and I offer the Universe my Dream Come True.
